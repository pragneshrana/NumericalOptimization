We'll construct a mathematical model of the business problem, implement this model in the Gurobi Python interface, and compute  an optimal solution.\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last ten years, smartphones have revolutionized our lives in ways that go well beyond how we communicate. Besides calling, texting, and emailing, more than two billion people around the world now use these devices to navigate to book cab rides, to compare product reviews and prices, to follow the news, to watch movies, to listen to music, to play video games,to take photographs, to participate in social media, and for numerous other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cellular network is a network of handheld smartphones in which each phone communicates with the telephone network by radio waves through a local antenna at a cellular base station (cell tower). One important problem is the placement of cell towers to provide signal coverage to the largest number of people."

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A telecom company needs to build a set of cell towers to provide signal coverage  for the inhabitants of a given city. A number of potential locations where the towers could be built have been identified. The towers have a fixed range, and -due to budget constraints- only a limited number of them can be built. Given these restrictions, the company wishes to provide coverage to the largest percentage of the population possible. To simplify the problem, the company has split the area it wishes to cover into a set of regions, each of which has a known population. The goal is then to choose  which of the potential locations the company should build cell towers on -in order to provide coverage to as many people as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cell Tower Coverage Problem is an instance of the Maximal Covering Location Problem [1]. It is also related to the Set Cover Problem. Set covering problems occur in many different fields, and very important applications come from the airlines industry. For example, Crew Scheduling and Tail Assignment Problem [2]."

    "Mathematical programming is a declarative approach where the modeler formulates a mathematical optimization model that captures the key aspects of a complex decision problem. The Gurobi Optimizer solves such models using state-of-the-art mathematics and computer science.\n",
